Car Price Prediction for Chinese Automobile Company Entering the US Market





This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict car prices in the American market. A Chinese automobile company is planning to enter the US market and is interested in understanding the factors that significantly affect car pricing. By analyzing these factors, the company seeks to gain insights into the price dynamics within this new market, helping it to make informed decisions regarding car design, manufacturing, and overall business strategy.

The company plans to set up its production facilities in the United States, positioning itself to compete with established US and European car manufacturers. However, to be competitive, the company needs a thorough understanding of the variables that influence car prices specifically in the American market, as these may differ significantly from those in China. For this purpose, the company has contracted an automobile consulting firm, which has collected a comprehensive dataset on various types of cars available across the American market. This dataset serves as the foundation for building a predictive model.

The consulting firm’s data allows for detailed analysis of the factors driving car prices, enabling the company to identify which variables are most impactful. By understanding how these variables affect pricing, the company can develop targeted strategies that align with different price levels in the US. This analysis aims to support the company in adjusting the design and features of its vehicles and refining its production and marketing approaches to better meet the demands of American consumers.

The primary goal of this project is to create a model that accurately predicts car prices based on the available independent variables. This model will provide valuable insights into how these variables impact prices, enabling the company’s management to identify and prioritize the most influential factors. With this understanding, the company can tailor its strategies to align with desired price points, optimizing its market entry approach. Furthermore, the model will offer a clearer picture of the American market’s pricing dynamics, which will help the company establish itself effectively and competitively in the new market.
